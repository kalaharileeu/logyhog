## Overview (Still working on this page jan 22)

Logyhog is a IOT dashboard. Logyhog was made to help monitor 100's of iot devices at a time. With features like pass/fail, y data, xy data and text data.

### Run Environment

Logyhog is deployed to an Kubenetes cluster or on Kubernetes on Windows that runs docker desktop. This project contains the deployment files and the instructions to do so.

```markdown
# Steps to your first logged data.
1. You will need to have a running insance of Logyhog.
2. You will need a copy of the Python 3 driver that will enable you to log data.
(As of 24 January 2022. My NetStandard 2.1 driver is out of date. I'm working to fix that.)
